# Adaptive-Discretization-Algorithm-for-Cotinuous-Space-HMMs
This project contains functions for Poisson-AR(1) HMMs. 
My main reference is Zimmerman at. al (2024) github.com/rob-zimmerman/SSM-flare. for useful_functions.R and HMM_Functions.R.
hmm_prediction.R reference formula in Zucchini et. al (2016).
auto_functions.R is the main algorithm proposed in the project.
useful_functions.R, HMM_Functions.R, auto_functions.R and hmm_prediction.R are main codes for simulation and earthquake data.

Experiment1 and Experiment3 coresponding to the Experiment1 and Experiment2 in report.

Earthquake and bootstrap code are about results in Earthquake part.
