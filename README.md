# Adaptive-Discretization-Algorithm-for-Cotinuous-Space-HMMs
his project contains functions for Poisson-AR(1) HMMs.  
My main reference is **Zimmerman et al. (2024)** [github.com/rob-zimmerman/SSM-flare](https://github.com/rob-zimmerman/SSM-flare) for some of the functions in `useful_functions.R` and `HMM_Functions.R`.  
`hmm_prediction.R` references formulas in **Zucchini et al. (2016)**.  
`auto_functions.R` is the main algorithm proposed in this project.  

## Folder Structure

- **Simulations/**  
  Contains results for the simulation studies in the report.  
  - `Experiment1/` and `Experiment3/` correspond to Experiment1 and Experiment2 in the report.

- **Earthquake/**  
  Contains codes and results for the earthquake dataset analysis, corresponding to the "Application to Earthquake Data" in the reportâ€™s Results section.  
  This folder also includes bootstrap code for parameter uncertainty evaluation.

- **MainFunctions/**  
  Contains the core functions for continuous-space HMMs, including likelihood evaluation, decoding, prediction, and the adaptive discretization algorithm.
